Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.
As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next.
And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(
So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature?
As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place,
you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear:
you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.
Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number;
if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

from typing import List

    ans = []
    j = 0
    if n == 0:
        return ans
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            if i < 3:
                ans.append(signature[i])
            else:
                ans.append(sum(ans[j:]))
                j += 1
        return ans
print(tribonacci([0, 0, 1], 10))

-----BEST PRACTICES-----

def tribonacci(signature, n):
  res = signature[:n]
  for i in range(n - 3): res.append(sum(res[-3:]))
  return res
  
#2
def tribonacci(signature,n):
    while len(signature) < n:
        signature.append(sum(signature[-3:]))
    return signature[:n]
